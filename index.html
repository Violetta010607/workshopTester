                    <p>Hello! I am <strong>Beatrice</strong>. The following 3 paragraphs are an Introduction of the workshop you are involved in. Please, take some time to read carefully.</p>
                    <p>In the early stages of my PhD research, before we were all forced to stay at home and then only move within small social groups, I conducted a study with blind people and their guides. Through this study, I have discovered the strong relationships that can develop in sighted guide partnerships. Over time, I have seen how pairs develop a sense of each other’s movements&nbsp;and also&nbsp;use conversation to move fluidly together. It is clear that sighted guide partnerships work very well and rely on people’s shared and creative use of skills and abilities.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this follow-up research, I am interested in the ways technology could be used to strengthen this partnership. Unlike other technological solutions that aim to&nbsp;prioritise&nbsp;independence, I am much more curious about how technology can support what already works so well, that is, the way blind people and their guides move together.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In this workbook, and in each of the following activities, I am inviting pairs to think about the ways they use their bodies together and communicate with one another in subtle and often creative ways. I also introduce some very simple technologies to help stimulate ideas for the role technology might play. What is really important&nbsp;in this workbook is that the activities are understood as starting points for strengthening people’s partnerships and not proposals for final solutions. I would like to create a language and set of tools that we can use to think together.&nbsp;</p><a class="btn btn-outline-primary visible" role="button" href="workbook.html">Find out more</a>
